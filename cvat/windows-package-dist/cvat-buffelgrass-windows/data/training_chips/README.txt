Place your training chip images (PNG or JPEG) in this directory.

The CVAT server will automatically see these files and you can
import them into your annotation tasks.

For example:
  - chip_001.png
  - chip_002.png
  - ...

After adding files, you can access them in CVAT:
  1. Create a Task
  2. Select files → "Connected file share"
  3. Select your images
  4. Start annotating!
